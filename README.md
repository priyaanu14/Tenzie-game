# Tenzie-game

In this game there are 4 dies with random numbers and you have to match the numbers of all the dies to win.
 There's a roll button to roll the dies and display a different number and you can also hold a number of dice by clicking on that dice.
 I also used some react hooks such as useState, useEffect and useRef.
 It is a react app which allows you to play the game Tenzie. 
 I have created this app as a part of my journey to learn react. 
 I used functional components.
 I have also added a timer feature that will record your time taken to complete this game.
 I have also used local storage to store the best time i.e. best least time taken by the player to win.
